Abstract

* This Graphics Package is developed using Open GL libraries support. OpenGL (Open Graphics Language) provides a powerful but primitive set of rendering commands. 
* It is an open specification for an applications program interface for defining 2D and3D objects. OpenGL is a low-level, procedural API, requiring the programmer to dictate the exact steps required to render a scene. 
* This package has been developed using Visual Studio 2010. The various features have been supported by mouse and keyboard interface. 
* The editor supports the following features: toolbars of menus, color pallets, drawing features like Line, Rectangle, Brush, freehand drawing, curve, text, clipping, eraser and selection. 
* This is a graphics editor that enables the user to input graphical data. Using the editor, the user can also save the information input by him/her into files or open existing files for editing. This editor provides a user-friendly GUI to create and edit the files. 
* This project aims to develop mostly a 2-D graphics package which supports basic operations which include creating objects like lines, circles, polygons, spirals, etc and also transformation operations like translation, rotation, etc on such objects.
*  The package must also have a user-friendly interface that may be menu-oriented, iconic or a combination of both. Ease of use along with an all-feature-providing interface is the main aim of this project.
